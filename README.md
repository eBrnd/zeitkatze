zeitkatze
=========

Zeitkatze is time cat -- literally

What's the simplest stopwatch in a linux console?
Well, just type `time cat` to start, and push ctrl-c to stop.
Zeitkatze is the same thing, with just a little extra.

It continuously updates the elapsed time display, you can hit ctrl-c once to display a split time,
and if you hit ctrl-d, (or ctrl-c twice in quick succession), zeitkatze prints the total time and
exits.
